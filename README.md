# Project description

The field of autonomous vehicles has seen rapid advancements, with perception systems playing a crucial
role in ensuring safe and efficient navigation. Among these, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)
sensors are essential for understanding a vehicleâ€™s surroundings. This project aims to enhance the
capabilities of LiDAR-based perception systems by developing a sensor model for LiDAR technology. The
focus will be on processing 3d point clouds to generate accurate occupancy grid maps, a fundamental
aspect of autonomous navigation. This sensor model will be implemented in the context of Transitional
Grid Maps, a recent analytical solution for inferring dynamic environments with limited sensing. In
this way the aim of the master thesis will be to develop the model sensor with the best performance
possible when integrated with this novel approach.
